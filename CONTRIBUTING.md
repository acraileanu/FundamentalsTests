We welcome contributions and feedback! Please read the [README](README.md) to set up your development environment, then read the guidelines below for information on submitting your code.

## Development process

1. Create a branch off of `master`: `git checkout -b YOUR_NAME/branch_name`.
2. Commit your changes. Make sure to add tests!
3. `git push` your changes to GitHub.
4. Make sure that all unit tests are passing and that there are no merge conflicts between your branch and `master`.
5. Open a pull request from `YOUR_NAME/branch_name` to `master`.
6. A repository maintainer will review your pull request and, if all goes well, merge it!

## Pull request acceptance criteria

* **All code must have test coverage.** Changes in functionality should have accompanying unit tests. Bug fixes should have accompanying regression tests.
