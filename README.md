# FundamentalsTests

Based on the idea that whenever you have a question about something fundamental in the C# language or are unsure how something works, the best way to tackle it is to write a test for it, Iâ€™ve decided to create this project that contains different tests for simple, yet sometime intriguing, components of the C# language.

The project uses NUnit as external package.


## String.Intern

MSDN Documentation: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.intern(v=vs.110).aspx

Purpose: tests to explain the reference and equality for strings and the internal string pool.
